Subject: Dynamic markings for 12 Chopin Etudes.  

For the "**dyn" representation, dynamic markings are very simply
represented:

<       hairpin crescendo
>       hairpin diminuendo
f       forte
ff      fortissimo
p       piano
sfz     sforzando
cres.	cres.
dim.	dim.

etc.

The period on a line by itself means that the preceding hairpin
graphical marking continues into the next measure.

----------------------------------------------

In order to process the files to determine patterns of dynamic
shading, try the following "pipeline" command.  (Don't be
intimidated by it's length:

sed '/=/d' chopin01 | rid -GLId | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | more

This will give you a simple inventory identifying the frequency
of each type of dynamic marking.  The "sed" command eliminates
barlines (=), the "rid" command eliminates global (G) and local (L)
comments, as well as Humdrum interpretations (I) and null data
tokens (d).  The "sort" command sorts all of the remaining data
records, and the "uniq" command counts the number of occurrences
of each uniq data type.  The "sort -nr" sorts the output so that
the most frequently occurring dynamic markings are displayed first.

For the above command, your results should look like this:

     28	<
     18	>
      8	p
      4	dim.
      4	cresc.
      2	pp
      2	poco cresc.
      2	f
      1	smorzando
      1	ppp
      1	piu f
      1	fzp

-- meaning that there are 28 hairpin crescendos in the chopin01 file, etc.

In the above command, the input is a single file "chopin01".  If
you want to include all of the encoded Chopin works type:

sed '/=/d' chopin* | rid -GLId | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | more

If you would like to put the results in a file named "results",
use the following:

sed '/=/d' chopin* | rid -GLId | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > results

You can also generate inventories for pairs of dynamic markings --
that is, the frequency of occurrences of

     < followed by >
     > followed by <
     f followed by >
     f followed by p
     etc.

In order to do this, try the following variant command:

sed '/=/d' chopin01 | rid -GLId | context -n 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | more

For the file "chopin01" the results should look like this:

     15	< >
     10	> <
      7	p <
      5	> p
      3	dim. >
      3	< cresc.
      3	< <
      2	pp <
      2	poco cresc. <
      2	< p
      2	< dim.
      1	smorzando pp
      1	piu f <
      1	p cresc.
      1	fzp <
      1	f dim.
      1	f <
      1	dim. smorzando
      1	cresc. piu f
      1	cresc. f
      1	cresc. dim.
      1	cresc. <
      1	> ppp
      1	> pp
      1	> poco cresc.
      1	< poco cresc.
      1	< fzp
      1	< f

-- meaning that there are 15 occurrences of a hairpin crescendo
followed by a hairpin diminuendo (<>) etc.

If you want "triples" or "quadruples", etc., rather than "pairs" simply
change the number following "context -n".  For example, to generate
"triples" inventories, type:

sed '/=/d' chopin01 | rid -GLId | context -n 3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | more

"quadruples" inventories, type:

sed '/=/d' chopin01 | rid -GLId | context -n 4 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | more

etc.


----------------------------------------------

PHRASING

If you are interested in including phrasing information in the
Humdrum data files (and so using phrases in the inventories),
use the open and closed braces -- { and } -- to indicate the
beginning and ends of phrases.  For example, the following
encoding represents three measures in which a phrase begins
after a forte marking, and where the phrase contains a
crescendo/diminuendo hairpin:

**dyn
=
f
{
=
<
>
=
}
